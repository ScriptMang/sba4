Reflection
Challenges faced during the project
I originally thought the deadline field was a date field. I thought the date would be important, but then realized its only time that mattered. Another challenge I faced was using the wrong methods for the different collections. I would often use the push method on html node element instead of append child.

How you approached solving those challenges.
So I managed to fix the deadline field issue by changing its input type to number. I also figured it out by reading the next the task in the project to get a better idea of the previous. I just felt the deadline task was somewhat opened in when the deadline should be . As for using the right methods with their type I look them up in the mdn docs when lost.

What you would improve if given more time.
If I had more time I probably ask for more clarification the deadline input field. I really wanted to figure out how to display the field better.
